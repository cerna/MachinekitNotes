Machinekit Machinetalk is __de facto__ standard for communication with, within or between Machinekit Instances.

== Machinetalk functions
* Faciliate communication between components (mainly non-RT but with overreach to RT space) inside running Machinekit Instance
* Faciliate communication between two or more running Machinekit Instances
* Faciliate communication between Machinekit Instance and arbitrary application based on client-server model (more or less)

== Main problems
* No documentation whatsoever
* No software definition of how things should work
* No active development (main author not active anymore)
* No clearly defined hierarchical structure of API and building blocks

== Building blocks
* ZeroMQ
* Protobuf
* Zeroconf/DNS-SD/mDNS

or

* Transport layer
* Serialization layer
* Propagation layer

== Main objective of this writeup

To define possible problems and propose possible solutions.
