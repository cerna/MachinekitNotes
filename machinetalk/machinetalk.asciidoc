Machinekit Machinetalk is __de facto__ standard for communication with, within or between Machinekit Instances.

== Machinetalk functions
* Faciliate communication between components (mainly non-RT but with overreach to RT space) inside running Machinekit Instance
* Faciliate communication between two or more running Machinekit Instances
* Faciliate communication between Machinekit Instance and arbitrary application based on client-server model (more or less)

== Main problems
* No documentation whatsoever
* No software definition of how things should work
* No active development (main author not active anymore)
* No clearly defined hierarchical structure of API and building blocks

=== No documentation available
The Machinekit Machinetalk endeavour has no developer documentation or software contract agreement which would precisely and in clean terms illuminate what Machinetalk is and is not, what are the objectives trying to be solved and how it should be done.

The absence of clear rules (defined in software agreement contract) means that every programmer can solve his problems in his own matter without any subsequent care about what others members of Machinekit community are developing.

== Building blocks

== Main objective of this writeup

To define possible problems and propose possible solutions.
